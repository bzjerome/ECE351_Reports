\section{Introduction}
 
This lab utilizes Laplace transform to create a graphical visual of the time-domain of an RLC circuit. The visuals include the impulse and step inputs of the RLC circuit. The sine method is used to generate the impulse. By creating a function for the sine method, this lab can be used in the future for any RLC circuit.

\section{Equations}

The Final Value Theorem is the limit of f(t) as t approaches infinity is equal to the limit of sF(s) as s approaches 0. Using this, the value for this lab is equal to 0 since there is an “s” term on the top of the equation, as shown below

\begin{equation1}
	$lim{f(t)} (as t approaches infinity) = lim{sF(s)} (as s approaches 0)$
\end{equation1}

\section{Methodology}

Begin by defining the RLC components. Then, create a working function for the sine method. This is done by hand calculating the time domain of the impulse response. Once this is done, specify the values for alpha, omega, the magnitude of g, and the phase of g. These are all found by calculating the Laplace transform. Next, create an array for the numerator and denominator of the Laplace response. This is done by replacing “s” with the value multiplying it in the equation: num = [s2, s, 1]. Finally, use Python’s sig.impulse() to generate a software created impulse to compare to the user generated impulse. When this is done, use sig.step() to find the step response of H(s) using the (num, den) arrays. Lastly, graph the first two generated graphs on one subplot, and the third graph as its own plot.

\section{Results}

The results for this lab are shown in the graphs below. Since the first graph (user created sine method) matches the graph for Python’s Impulse, the created sine method works properly. The step response is then shown below, which logically makes sense, as the graph is shifted when compared to the sine method. This indicates that the step response is working properly given sine wave characteristics.

\end{figure3}


\section{Error Analysis}

Sources of error for this lab would be user error. The biggest error would come from calculating the sine of H(s) properly. If anything of the sine method was wrong, the entire graph would be wrong. However, sine the user generated graph matches Python’s graph identically, there is no error in these calculations.

\section{Questions}

1.	Explain the result of the Final Value Theorem from Part 2 Task 2 in terms of the physical circuit components.
A1:	The final value is the value that the waveform will reach when it evens out. Since this H(s) has an "s" term in the numerator, the limit as "s" approaches 0 will be 0. This happens because of the inductor/capacitor combination. They both will release the voltage held an eventually output 0 volts.

2.	Leave any feedback on the clarity of the expectations, instructions, and deliverables.
A2:	I have no feedback. This lab was overall easy to understand and fun to work through.


\section{Conclusion}

This lab was very interesting to work through. By comparing hand calculations to Python’s functions, I noticed how useful Python can be for these kinds of problems. Using the given functions would save plenty of time when working on homework or a project. In the end, the calculations worked properly, and the graphs all looked good.
